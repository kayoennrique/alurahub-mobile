## :information_source: What is AluraHub?

AluraHub is an application made in React Native that allows you to save a profile with information such as the person's name and a photo, and allows you to consult a repository that stores data.

How does it work? The app consumes an external API, in this case, Github's public API or a fake API with json-server.

This project is used in course 4 of the basic React Native training on the Alura platform.
